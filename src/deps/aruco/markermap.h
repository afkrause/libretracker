/**\brief This class defines a set of markers whose locations are attached to a common reference system, i.e., they do not move wrt each other.
 * A MarkerMap contains several markers so that they are more robustly detected.
 *
 * A MarkerMap is only a list  of the id of the markers along with the position of their corners.
 * A MarkerMap may have information about the dictionary the markers belongs to @see getDictionary()
 *
 * The position of the corners can be specified either in pixels (in a non-specific size) or in meters.
 * The first is the typical case in which you generate the image of  board  and the print it. Since you do not know in advance the real
 * size of the markers, their corners are specified in pixels, and then, the translation to meters can be made once you know the real size.
 *
 * On the other hand, you may want to have the information of your boards in meters. The MarkerMap allows you to do so.
 *
 * The point is in the mInfoType variable. It can be either PIX or METERS according to your needs.
 *
