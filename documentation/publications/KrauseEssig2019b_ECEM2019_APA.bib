  abstract  = {LibreTracker is a free and open-source eyetracking software, licensed
	under the GPL-3. It is targeted at low-cost and do-it-yourself head-mounted
	Eyetrackers like the Pupil Labs headset, but works with other headsets
	as well. Implemented in modern C++, it has only minimal dependencies
	(OpenCV and the Fast Light Toolkit) and runs on many platforms (e.g.
	Windows, Linux and MacOS). Due to its small performance footprint,
	LibreTracker scales from powerful desktop workstations down to embedded
	devices.  All USB video class compliant cameras can be used, with
	camera focus and exposure being adjustable for many of them. Using
	AR markers, the distortion of the scene camera can be evaluated,
	and, if necessary, calibrated. Further, we use on-screen AR markers
	to implement easy to use n-point calibration and scene-camera pose-estimation,
	such that the on-screen gaze point can be calculated regardless of
	head movements. For pupil-center estimation, we use a highly improved
	version [Krause and Essig, ETRA, 2019] of gradient based dark pupil
	tracking [Timm and Barth, Visapp 11, p. 125–130, 2011] that can be
	scaled to require less than 15ms per frame on a Raspberry Pi or less
	than 1ms on a Workstation. As an application scenario, we have implemented
	an eyetracking speller with a full virtual keyboard.  The source
